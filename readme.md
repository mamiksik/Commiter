### ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't forget to run the inference server
For the plugin to work you have host completion server somewhere. To do that, you can install the [Parrot Inference Server](https://github.com/mamiksik/ParrotInferenceServer) and run it in background.

### Usage
To use Parrot, simply start typing your commit message as usual. When you want to get a suggestion for the next word, use the autocomplete shortcut (typically Ctrl + Space or Cmd + Space). Parrot will then generate a list of suggestions based on the words you have already typed. You can select the suggestion you want to use and it will be automatically inserted into your message.
